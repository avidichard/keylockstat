Display NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock status in notification area

For those, like me, who do not have numlock, capslock and scrolllock status leds on their keyboards, this simple tool adds notification area icons.

Fully customizable.

* Choose which icons to hide
* Single executable portable file
* Start with window

No installation is required.

Developped in Visual Basic 6...Yes, yes, you read right, I developped that in Visual Basic 6 under Windows 11. Impressive how old school stuff is so easy to implement and still operational.
