Display NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock status in notification area

For those, like me, who do not have NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock status leds on their keyboards or want a visual reference in the notifications area, this simple tool adds notification area icons.

Fully customizable.

* Choose which icons to hide
* Single executable portable file
* Start with window

No installation is required.

Developped in Visual Basic 6...Yes, yes, you read right, I developped that in Visual Basic 6 under Windows 11 to try some old 32 bit apps in the new OS. Impressive how old school stuff is so easy to implement and still fully operational.
